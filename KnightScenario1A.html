			<h2>The Village</h2>
			<h3>Drawing you sword you wait for them to pass the cart. Once they have both past you attack. Two swings it all it takes to bring both men down, but not before they scream in shock.  
			You do not have time to get the pack the first soldier was carrying before a group of soldiers run into the square.  Darting to the relative safety between two buildings you watch as the women tries 
			to run, dragging her children along.  You begin to move away back towards the forest, you hear the unmistakable screams of the woman and then silence, broken a few seconds later by the wailing sobs 
			of a child begging for their mother to wake up.  You move into the forest cursing the bloody invaders for killing defenceless women and children. It was not your fault, was it? Never mind now, best 
			just find the trail heading south and move on.  Besides they were only peasants.</h3>
