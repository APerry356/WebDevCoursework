			<h2>KNIGHT</h2>
			<h3>One of the few last remaining career soldiers left in the army. You've been fighting this war from the beginning all the way to the bitter end.  You've seen the destruction that your homeland has been subjected to and you know all to well the effect its had on its people. You're very out
			of place without your fellow knights around you, not used to dealing with the peasentry. You will stand out on your journey, some will be scared of you, some may respect the fight you put up, but most will hate you. Some of the choices made by the nobility for the "good of the realm" do not sit 
			well with the common people as they often bore the brunt of these actions.</h3>

			<h2>ARCHER</h2>
			<h3>You were drawn into this war almost as soon as the invasion began.  The army was quick to grab anyone with any combat skills, and being proficient with a bow was very desirable. The war was nothing like you were used to.  Hunting animals in the forrests to feed your family, selling pelts and fur 
			could not be further away from what you experienced, hundreds of men raining death upon the enemy.  You have no idea how many people your arrows have killed.  You're more at home in the forrests and lands than you are in large cities.  You've learnt that staying unseen and away from other people
			is often the best way to stay alive, as long as you survive the monsters that inhabbit the wilderness away from the eyes of humans.</h3>

			<h2>ROGUE</h2>
			<h3>Your role in the war is one that is not talked about much, at least publically.  Your unique set of skills made you good at a range of morally ambiguous tasks.  Over the course of the war you did various "jobs", from assasinating enemy officers to "encourging" peasents to hand over their crops
			for the army. You're at home in cities and towns, blending in amoungst the local population, picking up valuable infomation and making some money on the side whilst hiding in plain sight.  You've learnt that more often than not, especially when things get desperate, people are often the worst monsters.</h3>
