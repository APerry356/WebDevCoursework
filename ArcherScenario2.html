			<h2>The Road</h2>
			<h3>You follow the road south.  You come across a cart with short, dog like creatures gnawing at what looks like a body besides it.  Your keen eyes spot two people hiding in the cart trying to stay quiet.  Getting closer to the car you see 
			those are no dogs, those are ghouls.  Small dog like creatures that eat the dead, where there’s a battlefield you will find ghouls nearby.  Seems this pack got too hungry to find a dead body.  You see one move from the body, sniffing the 
			air it moves towards the back of the cart where the people are hiding.  What do you do?  The cart looks to be a merchant cart, there’s probably lots of supplies tucked away in it.</h3>
			
			
			
			
		
			<h3>Fire at the Ghouls, They are skittish creatures, kill a few and they should flee.</h3>

			<h3>Move deeper into the forest and pass around them.  You are a hunter, not a monster hunter.  You'd rather not be their next meal.</h3>

			<h3>Kill the Ghouls but loot the cart, you will need those supplies for your journey, surely they can spare some food now one of their party is dead.</h3>
