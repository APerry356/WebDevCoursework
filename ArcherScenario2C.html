			<h2>The Road</h2>
			<h3>You target the Ghoul heading towards the back of the cart.  Your arrow breaks through its skull and pins it too the wooden cart.  Pulling a fire arrow from you are quiver you light it and send it into the group on the body.  
			As soon as the arrow makes contact with the Ghouls they lung back, one set ablaze as it runs.  It falls to the ground twitching uncontrollably.  The rest of the Ghouls run into the forest screeching in fear.  You approach the cart 
			and order the occupants to climb out.  Once they have climbed out you tell them to drop a pack with food in it on the floor.  They size you up, wondering if you would really hurt them.  Drawing your bow you repeat your request.  
			Moving down the road you much happier now you have some food.  The journey just got much easier.
