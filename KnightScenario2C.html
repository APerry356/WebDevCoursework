			<h2>The Trail</h2>
			<h3>Stepping out of cover behind a tree you approach the bandits.  Shouting at them from the centre of the trail you inform them they are surrounded, and they should move along or face execution for the murder of civilians.  You watch as the bandits look around for the non-existent force surrounding 
			them.  You notice how desperate they look, the way they clutch their bags close to their chests.  The oldest on, a man no older than 30, steps forward and explains they only want food and they want no trouble.  They move off the trail and run past you the way you came.  You continue the march south 
			until the sky turns a bright orange and you are forced to make camp.  You hope the bandits did not follow you.</h3>
