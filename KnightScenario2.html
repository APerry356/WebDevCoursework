			<h2>The Trail</h2>
			<h3>You have been moving down the trail when you spot a group of men looting some bodies. They are wearing no colours of sigils. Bandits. They must be trying to hunt down groups of refugees, taking what little they have left.
			You count 3 of them.  You doubt there are more about, the larger groups were hunted down by both sides during the invasion. They look desperate, half starved and one of them seems to be limping.  Did they kill these people?  They do not look like they 
			have much fight left in them.</h3>
			
			
			
			
		
			<h3>Move towards the Group and kill them. Who knows what supplies they might have gathered. You do feel pretty hungry.</h3>

			<h3>Creep past them, best not get involved in another fight.  Besides you do not want to draw attention to yourself.</h3>
