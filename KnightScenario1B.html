			<h2>The Village Of The Dead</h2>
			<h3>You hide where you are behind the cart. Once the soldiers have past you, to focused on their conversation to notice you, you creep towards the woman and her children.  You tell her to keep quiet and guide her towards the 
			forest.  When you reach the trail a man and a young boy spring out from behind a tree and run towards you. Drawing your sword, you step in front of the  women and her children. You are about to order the man to stop where he 
			is but then the women darts towards the man and jumps into his arms.  Once the man is free of the embrace he moves towards you. He thanks you for saving his wife and children.  They move north into the forest towards the 
			border, hopefully they will be able to escape the country.</h3>
