			<h2>The Trail</h2>
			<h3>Darting from cover you stab the first man you reach through the stomach. By the time he has hit the floor you decapitate the next man as he stands up, a womans necklace clutched in his hand. The final man has drawn his sword and steps towards you. You notice his limp and point your sword at him.
			He swings his sword at you and you easily dodge to the left.  Kicking his feet out from under him you stab your sword downwards, ending his life.  You resume where they left off, you pick up a water skin and a small bag of food from one body, then you move to the bandits and pluck the necklace from the dead
			bandits hand.  You move further down the trail, away from the scene and notice the sun is setting.  Time to make camp.</h3>
