			<h2>The Road</h2>
			<h3>You target the Ghoul heading towards the back of the cart.  Your arrow breaks through its skull and pins it too the wooden cart.  Pulling a fire arrow from you are quiver you light it and send it into the group on the body.  
			As soon as the arrow makes contact with the Ghouls they dart back, one set ablaze as it runs.  It falls to the ground twitching uncontrollably.  The rest of the Ghouls run into the forest screeching in fear.  You approach the 
			cart and inform the occupants that they are safe.  A old women and a young boy stumble out and burst into tears when they see the body.  You inform them they should burn the body before they move off.  A body that has been partially 
			eaten by Ghouls with change into one. A fate no one deserves.</h3>
