			<h2>KNIGHT START</h2>
			<h3>You wake up to screaming. You are laying flat on your back, weighed down by your armour, starring at the open skys partially covered by rising smoke. "How did I get here?" You mutter outlound. Slowly you realise the screaming is not a human sound, you look up and see a horse
			struggling in the mud, cuts and bloody marks covering its body. All of a sudden the memories come flooding you back, almost pushing you back down into the mud. The battle, the last reminants of the Keadwinian Army, or of what was left of it, attempting to hold back the enemy from destroying another village. 
			The desperate chavelry charge, your horse being torn apart by arrows, flinging you down.  You begin to relise there is no familar sounds of battle raging around you, just the screams of horses in pain and the screaching of crowns.  </h3>
			
			<h3>Standing up you look around, you notice the bodies of your fallen comrades litering the ground, the fire raging on the hill where the infantry and archers held there ground. You look for movement, any movement, any sign of life, there is none.  Only raging fire and billowing smoke. What 
			do you do now? Has anyone survived? You remember your comander telling you about the fall back position in a town to the north. Anyone who survived will be there, they have to be right? Your commamdng officers words ring in your ear, "If we have to fall back go into the forest you'll find a river,
     		follow it upstream and it will lead you to the village. We're going to hold them back, no more burned villages. We just need to hold on a little longer lads, help will come!".  No one believed him of course, would the Temerian army really cross the border to help? </h3>
			
			<h3>As if you're being guided by spirits, your legs carry you towards the forrest, towards the river. Can you face another battle?</h3>
