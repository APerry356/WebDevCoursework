			<h1>Attacked Village</h1>
			
			
			
			<h3>You are moving from the forest track and into another village.  The enemy has already been through this village. Some of the buildings are burnt down, some have kicked in doors and others have splattering’s of blood staining the woodwork.  
			As soon as you stop foot into the village you are noticed by the people out on the street.  If you were expecting a war welcome this could not be further from it.  A group is forming behind you, following you through the village.  You stop by a young 
			boy sat outside a burnt down house.  He looks up at you, notices the blood and muck covering your armour and stares into your eyes.  “Where were you when they came here? They burnt down my house.  I can’t find my dad or my mum.  They took my mum.  My dad 
			said you’d protect us, why didn’t you?”.  Your voice chokes in your throat, what can you say?  You move away and suddenly you feel something bounce from your chest plate, a rock, people are throwing rocks at you.  You run from the village, followed by a hail 
			of rocks.  A crowd of people blocks your way, most of they are carrying clubs, one man has a length of rope in his hands.  What do you do?</h3>
			
			
			
			
		
			<h3>Fight through the crowd to escape.  If it comes down to it you will chose your life over theirs.</h3>

			<h3>Try run. You do not want to hurt them but you are not looking forward to finding out what they have planned for that rope.</h3>

			<h3>Try talk them down, explain what happened and ask if theres anything you can do to help.</h3>
