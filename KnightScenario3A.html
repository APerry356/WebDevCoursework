			<h2>Attacked Village</h2>
			<h3>You draw your sword and look them over, trying to spot the weakest and the one's who look the strongest.  Seeing you pull out a weapon to fight scares some and they move away, but most stand their ground.  To them you just proved them right, 
			the nobility does not care for them.  They must feel confident seen as they outnumber you, this is your advantage.  One-man steps forward and swings hammer at you, he has made the mistake of targeting your weapon instead of you.  Dodging to the left, 
			you slice your blade downwards in a diagonal swipe.  The man falls to the floor clutching his leg.  Two more step forward trying to push you back towards the centre of the village where you will be boxed in.  To catch them off you do what they least expect, 
			attack.  With one wide slash of your sword you send them both to the floor, only one is making any noise.  The crowd is breaking up now, their confidence shattered.  You move quickly away from the village, deciding to stick to the main road.  There has to 
			more knights somewhere, maybe at the keep two days away? Anything is better than being caught out here fighting these ungrateful presents.
