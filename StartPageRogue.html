			<h2>Rogue START</h2>
			<h3>You move quickly through the village towards the main square where the horses are hitched.  Organising this village as a fall back position for the army was dificult, the village elders begged you to go anywhere else, by this point in the war everyone knows what happens to a village in the way
			of the invasion.  Villages get looted by both sides, the defending army claim the crops for the army and the invading force takes whats left to feed theirs, not to mention the terrible acts that soldiers do moving through villages.  Getting to your horse, you unhitch it and mount it.  Making towards
			the main road, you spot the General and his commanders, there horses throthing at their mouths from sprinting. </h3>
			<h3>Once you reach the group of officers, you explain to them the village is ready as ordered.  Fixing you with depressed looks they explain the situation. The army is in the process of being destroyed, those left alive are fleeing for their lives.  The general approaches you with a satchel.  He informs you
			it is filled with orders for resistance eliments deep behind enemy lines.  The orders must make it, they must not fall into enemy hands if there is any hope of continued resistance to the invasion.</h3>
			<h3>With your knew orders you leave the village, following a winding road through the forrest towards the next village, you contemplate your next task: Slipping through the enemies front line.</h3>
