			<h1>Attacked Village</h1>
			<h3>You set up some basic targets in a field behind the village and scavenge some bows from the village stores.  You spend two days teaching three volunteers the basics of archery, how to take care of their equipment and 
			how to make basic arrows.  When you leave the village you hear them discussing using their knew found skills to join the resistance to fight the invaders, you cannot help but feel you have somehow made a mistake.</h3>
