			<h2>The Village</h2>
			<h3>You string your bow and move behind a house. Creeping forward you nock an arrow look for targets.  There, an enemy pushing a knight to the ground.  You draw your bow to the centre of your cheek and loose your arrow at his back.
			Your arrow hits him the back, splitting his light leather armour, before he has fallen you draw your bow again. You spot another target, a man trying to kick down a door to a house.  He turns around as the arrow hits him in the throat, he drops to the ground, 
			shock written all over his face. As you are pulling another arrow from the quiver at your side, you spot the General crossing swords with an enemy knight in full plate armour.  You are not quick enough to stop the General from being knocked to the ground but
			you hit the Knight in the side, in the gap between his breast plate and the back plate.  He falls to the ground coughing blood.  The knights you have tried to save do not wait around to see who their saviour was, they mount their horses and sprint away down the 
			road before you can step from cover.</h3>
