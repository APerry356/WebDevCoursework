			<h2>The Village Of The Dead</h2>
			<h3>Pushing off from the cart you begin to run. You hear the shouts of surprise as you run between two buildings and then into the forest, they chase after you but they quickly fall behind. You hide and wait for them to move
			back towards the village.  Once they have gone you move towards the trail leading towards the next village to the south.  You'll never know if the woman escaped or not, but you are sure you gave her a chance.</h3>
