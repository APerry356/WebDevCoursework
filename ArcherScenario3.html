			<h1>Attacked Village</h1>
			
			
			
			<h3>You are moving from the forest track and into another village.  The enemy has already been through this village. Some of the buildings are burnt down, some have kicked in doors and others have splatteringâ€™s of blood staining the woodwork.  
			As soon as you stop foot into the village you are noticed by the people out on the street.  You see the hopelessness in the eyes of the villagers.  You walk up to the village tavern and ask what happened here.  The owner of the tavern explains that
			when the enemy past through they took all the food from the stores, and with all the working men being conscripted by the army they cannot hunt food.  What should you do?</h3>
			
			
			
			
		
			<h3>Offer to hunt some animals for the village.</h3>
