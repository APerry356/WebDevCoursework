			<h1>Attacked Village</h1>
			<h3>You look through the crowd and attempt to spot someone in charge. Speaking to the crowd you explain your situation, you explain what happened and what the larger picture of the war is.  You offer to help the village in any way you can to make up for the 
			militaryâ€™s failure in protecting them.  One man steps forwards and informs you of a pack of beasts that has been attacking farmers in their fields ever since the war made it this far north. You agree to hunt down the beast to stop its rein of terror on the 
			village.</h3>
