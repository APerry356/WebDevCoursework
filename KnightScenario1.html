			<h2>The Village</h2>
			<h3>You make it to the town and instantly notice how earily quiet it is. There are no sounds of human life you would expect from a village this size. Moving down the main street you stop the bodies, you notice the kicked it doors and damaged carts. Making it into the village square 
			you spot the fallen banners of your company, more dead horses and finally the bodies of the commanders.  You instantly identify the body of the General with his striped cape billowing in the breeze, he did not have time to escape the enemies rapid advance even with your desperate last charge 
			to distract the enemy.  Moving around the square you notice how no one was spared, not the women and not the children.  You rest by a flipped cart and consider your options, you cannot stay here but where can you go?  No one gave you any orders for a situation like this.  You remember the general
			talking to the other officers, talking about how they should order their "special" troops to sneak past the enemy line and begin forming resistance groups.  </h3>
			<h3>Your rest is disturbed when two men stumble out of the tavern the on the otherside of the cart, talking loudly about how happy they are to have recieved such a simple task, how much they are looking forward to returning home to their children.  
			They dont seem to have noticed you. Looking around the square you notice a woman holding her two childen close, waiting for the soldiers to leave to escape.  What should you do?</h3>
			
			
			
			
		
			<h3>Kill them. Look at the damage they have caused.  They killed your General and left him to the crows.  If there are more soldiers somewhere will the women and her children be able to get away in time? One of soldier have a pack, you could really do with the supplies he's carrying.</h3>
