			<h2>The Village</h2>
			<h3>You make it too the village in good time.  Your experience moving and living in forests makes you fast navigating this difficult terrain.  When you reach the village you see the Officers from your army battling a group of enemy soldiers.  
			The battle looks desperate.  A few well placed arrows could turn the tide of the battle.  Then again do you really want to get involved in another fight?  You watch of the inhabitants of the village flee and try escape before more foreign 
			invaders attack.</h3>
			
			
			
			
		
			<h3>String your bow and shoot some of the enemies.  Time to claw back some honour after you abandoned your company.</h3>

			<h3>Hide where you are. Wait for the battle to end then move in and scavenge some supplies.  No point fighting for the men that abandoned you.</h3>

			<h3>Move away from the village, if you head south you'll surely find another village.  Hopefully one with a few less fights going on in it.</h3>
